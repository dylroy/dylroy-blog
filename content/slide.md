# About

Ciao! My name is Dylan and welcome to my digital garden! I'm a second-year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a master's degree in Geography in the department of Earth, Geographic, and Climate Sciences. I'm also a second-year NE CASC (North East Climate Adaption Science Center) [research fellow](https://necasc.umass.edu/people/dylan-roy).

I love taking notes, organizing my thoughts, and consolidating my knowledge. I also love sharing my creations and ideas. That's why I started this site which is a living and breathing collection of works, ideas, projects, rants, and whatever else I decide I want filed away. I hope you enjoy browsing as much as I did making this site!
